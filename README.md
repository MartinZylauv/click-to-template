# click-to-template
Another "playground" repository for testing out some code before it goes into the implementation phase. This project is about testing the functionality of adding my own custom sub-menus on the windows right-click action, and then executing some code that will create a new excel file based on a template, so that the people working with the templates all day will have an easy way of creating a new version of the template directly inside a folder instead of opening excel and choosing a template. This is JUST for testing out the functionalities of the libaries, and nothing ready for the public to see. Take a look and learn from my mistakes, and take a look at the final project when i get around to that :-)
